# timezone-picker-using-micromodal  

This program allows you to click a button that pulls up a modal.  

In the modal you click another button that creates a drop down menu for 3 other buttons.  

On the buttons is 3 different cities and clicking them will display the current time in that time zone.  

After looking at it I probably should've added an element that changes per click but I don't wanna.

Uses npm install moment moment-timezone
